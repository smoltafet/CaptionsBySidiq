CaptionBySide is a generator specifically for the Persian language. The captions generator takes a video, transcribes it to Persian and than applies captions on the video. The captions can be adjustable with a nice editor and you have options like colors, margins, etc. I built the project from scratch using Next.JS 13, React, Tailwind.css and WebAssembly. For storage I used an AWS S3 bucket and for transcription we I used an AWS Transcribe service. 

TO RUN:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
